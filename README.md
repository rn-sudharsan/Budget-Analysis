# Financial Budget Analysis with Python

This project analyzes the India Budget 2021 dataset to understand the distribution of funds among different government departments. The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

The dataset is loaded and cleaned to ensure data integrity. Main departments are prioritized, and a separate category for others is created. The project aims to visualize and interpret the budget allocation to gain insights into government priorities.

## Analysis and Visualization

Bar charts are used to identify prioritized departments based on allocated funds. Additionally, a donut plot is generated to visually represent the percentage share of funds among all departments.

## Key Findings

The finance department emerges as the largest recipient, receiving around 40% of the total budget. This emphasizes the government's focus on financial management and economic stability.

## Conclusion

The project showcases the use of Python for effective government budget analysis. It provides valuable insights into government priorities and spending patterns, offering a better understanding of economic policies and fiscal decisions.
